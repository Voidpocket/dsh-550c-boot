/**
 * Builds lib/client.js — the single browser module the client loader expects.
 *
 * No bundler and no build dependencies on purpose. The client half may be
 * written in plain JavaScript: the loader's factory hands the module a
 * `require` that resolves the externals a plugin is allowed to use (`react`,
 * `react/jsx-runtime`), and the plugin's own sources are concatenated below
 * into that factory's body. That is exactly the shape tsdown emits for the
 * published client plugins — see any `lib/client.js` under
 * $DSH_HOME/profiles/*\/node_modules.
 *
 * Order matters: assets (stylesheet + markup) → show (the animation) → client
 * (the React surfaces and the plugin export). All three are plain top-level
 * declarations, so concatenation is a valid module body.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build.mjs
