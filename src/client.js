 *
 * The show plays once per client boot. `#app`'s markup is only mounted in full

/**
 * The host element's own sheet, in the DOCUMENT rather than the shadow root.
 *
 * Two separate reasons, both measured against real third-party sheets:
 *
 *   geometry   any document-level rule outranks a `:host` declaration, because
 *              the shadow root cannot defend its host from outside. The dsh-web
 *              family bundle ships exactly such a rule for a marker this plugin
 *              used to borrow —
 *              `[data-dsh-boot-splash]{position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:9999;
 *              background:var(--dsw-alias-bg-base,#1e1e20);pointer-events:none;
 *              transition:opacity 160ms …}` — which silently disabled
 *              click-to-skip (`pointer-events:none`), dropped the overlay under
 *              the app's own layers (9999), repainted it and replaced the
 *              hand-off transition. The marker is now this plugin's own
 *              (`data-dsh-550c-boot`, see mountOverlay) and these declarations
 *              are `!important`, so no third-party sheet can take the overlay
 *              over again.
 *
 *   drag       DSH's official base stylesheet turns every DIRECT body child into
 *              a `-webkit-app-region: no-drag` region on darwin — its selector,
 *              `html[data-platform=darwin] body>:not(#root)`, spares only the
 *              app's own root element. A viewport-spanning body child therefore
 *              subtracts the whole window from the draggable region: while the
 *              splash is up the window cannot be dragged by its title area and
 *              macOS stops running the system double-click action there.
 *              `pointer-events: none` does not exempt an element from that
 *              computation; only a declaration of its own does. `initial` is the
 *              initial value (`none`), which takes the element OUT of the
 *              computation instead of turning the whole overlay into a drag
 *              handle — click-to-skip keeps working. `!important` is required
 *              because the official selector outranks this one.
 *
 * `aria-hidden="true"` on the host is the second half of the drag story: the
 * family bundle exempts that standard attribute too, so an install that ships it
 * gets the same treatment without this plugin borrowing a family-private name.

 * (the ported UI keeps its own ─ □ ✕ inside the fake window titles, which is
 * where the design wants them). Two things stop them reading as foreign chrome:
 *
 *   footprint  the stylesheet reserves the strip inside #hud-top, so the HUD's
 *              TIME / ● REC are not pushed under the buttons (data-caption).
 *   strip      the Desktop preload measures a probe element's computed
 *              `background-color` / `color` and pushes them to
 *              `setTitleBarOverlay({color, symbolColor})` over IPC, re-measuring
 *              whenever <head> mutates. Both values accept alpha, so the strip is
 *              made TRANSPARENT while the splash plays: the buttons float on the
 *              animation instead of sitting on an opaque bar, and the symbols are
 *              painted in the splash's accent so they stay legible on it.
 *
 * The colours are declared ON THE PROBE ELEMENT, not on :root. The probe is a
 * body-level `<span>` whose inline style reads the app's two tokens, and the app
 * defines them on `body`: custom properties resolve from the CLOSEST ancestor, so
 * a `:root` override never reaches it — `!important` on `html` loses to a plain
 * declaration on `body` (measured on the real window: the strip stayed opaque for
 * the whole splash while the sheet looked correct). Declaring both colours on the
 * probe sidesteps inheritance and leaves the app's own tokens — and its text
 * colour — untouched. `transparent` is a real value here: the preload normalises
 * it through a canvas to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, which the shell's own colour check
 * accepts, so the strip really does become see-through.
 *
 * Removing the sheet afterwards puts the app's own colours back, because that
 * mutation of <head> is itself the re-measure trigger.

/**
 * The version row: what is installed, whether anything newer exists, and — when
 * the host is allowed to do it — the update itself.
 *
 * DSH has no plugin updater of its own (the inventory surface is read-only), so
 * this is the one place a user can ask. Both calls go to the HOST half's routes
 * (`GET /dsh-550c-boot/update`, `POST /dsh-550c-boot/update/apply`), not to the
 * registry: the served document's CSP is restrictive and the host process already
 * owns outbound network access, so same-origin calls keep the client free of CORS
 * and CSP questions. The check reads npm (the host tries the npmmirror mirror
 * first, then the official registry); the update runs the profile's own package
 * manager through the DSH CLI, which is the only supported way to change a
 * profile's plugins. Nothing happens until a button is pressed.
